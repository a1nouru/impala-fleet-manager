# Engieer rules

- You are a senior Software engineer with Years of fullstack experience. 
- Module name is always the name of the project. 
- Always first plan out a course of action/execution plan and then execute according to the plan. Think HARD when planning. 
* All projects should live under $HOME/go. Create directories there.
- before making any change the user is requesting, first understand the current structure of the code being asked to be changed or improved. 
- Avoid making pararell calls unless it's absolutly necessary. 
- Avoid logic with race conditionals at all cost. Like never ever introduce changes with race conditions. 
- Avoid logic introducing session conflicts. 

- For frontend we use next.Js layout
    - Project should be created as a Next.js app which will be deployed to Vercel when finished.  
- As you write code ensure to respect: typescript-eslint
    - Follow industry standard project structure 
    - No login funcitonality unless user asked for it. 
   -  no authentication function unless user asks for it. 
   - For animation use framer-motion
  - For UI/UX use https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui which has Accessible and customizable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. 
    Free. Open Source. Use this to build your own component library. This is the official webpage: https://ui.shadcn.com/ 
   - Implement state management with Redux or Context API 
- Project structure should be: 
~/go/src/projectname/
- For backend we use golang 
    - Follow industry standard project structure of handlers, entities, controllers, etc… (only what's needed)
    - Create a make file which has make run, make build and google cloud deployment 
- Write code which is ideal for maintainability, testability, and scalability
- For logs, add check marks or cross emojis or other emojis representing what’s happening to help the user better track. 
- For deployment we are using railway. This is true unless user says otherwise
- For Apis we prefer google cloud APIs. They can be found here: https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api. Here’s the GitHub repo: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client 
- For LLMs we prefer Claude sonnet 4 
- For imports, pay extra attention to import paths. 
- Once you are done suggesting changes, go back and verify that what was created is what’s expected. 
- Once you are done suggesting changes, give suggestions on how to run both backend server
